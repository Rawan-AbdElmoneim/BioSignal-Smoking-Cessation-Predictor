# BioSignal-Smoking-Cessation-Predictor

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict an individual's smoking status using bio-signals. By leveraging various features such as nicotine dependency, carbon monoxide levels, daily cigarette consumption, age of smoking initiation, previous quit attempts, emotional well-being, personality traits, and motivation to quit, the model assists healthcare professionals and individuals in assessing the likelihood of successfully quitting smoking. This project integrates data analysis, feature engineering, ensemble methods, and hyperparameter tuning to create a robust predictive system.

## Objectives
- **Data Analysis**: Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to gain foundational insights for feature identification and manipulation.
- **Feature Engineering and Preprocessing**: Extract, create, and select features based on insights from data analysis. Explore how feature modifications influence model outcomes.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Implement bagging, boosting, and random forests to enhance predictive accuracy and robustness.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model performance using grid search and randomized search techniques.
- **Final System**: Develop a final machine learning system with the best performance by integrating insights from all previous steps.
